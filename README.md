# Source_Code_Scraper
This Is Another Fun Project I Created! This One Takes A URL From You And Then Scrapes It's Source Code And Writes It To A File Called Source_Code.txt. Please Note: This Only Scrapes The Page You Have Given It To Scrape, For Example It Will Only Scrape The HomePage Of Python Website If Given 'https://www.python.org'.
